// Given an integer array nums, return the number of subarrays filled with 0.
// A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
// Output: 6
// Explanation:
// There are 4 occurrences of [0] as a subarray.
// There are 2 occurrences of [0,0] as a subarray.
// There is no occurrence of a subarray with a size more than 2 filled with 0. Therefore, we return 6

// let subarray=0
// Count =0
// Run for loop at i throw i
// If (nums===0)
// Count ++;
// subarray=subarray+count;
// else
// Count=0

// clg(subarray);
// Given an array of distinct integers candidates and a target integer target, return a list of all unique combinations of candidates where the chosen numbers sum to target. You may return the combinations in any order.
// The same number may be chosen from candidates an unlimited number of times. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
// The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up to target is less than 150 combinations for the given input.
// Example 1:
// Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
// Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
// Explanation:
// 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times.
// 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7.
// These are the only two combinations
// final=0;
// Final Arr=[]

// For loop of candidate
// Candidate = jeep
// if(jeep >final)



/*1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element
Given a binary array nums, you should delete one element from it.
Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].
